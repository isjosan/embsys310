# Field Camera to Monitor Remote Industrial Operations

## 1. Introduction

Remote Industrial Sites present unique challenges to operate efficiently and effectively. Examples of these sites include construction sites, oil rigs, unmanned industrial stations, industrial farms, and weather monitoring stations. The utility power source is either non-existent or available at a premium, WiFi is not guaranteed for 24x7 Internet connection; and you have to contend with the elements of extreme weather. In addition it can be expensive to permanently station human operators at these sites; and every physical visit to the site for installation, maintenance and supervision adds to the cost of performing industrial operations. On the other hand, it is also expensive to deploy a human operator for remote and continuous video surveillance.

As shown in Figure 1. Field Camera is one example of an embedded device that addresses the challenges of Remote Industrial Operations. It is essentially a standalone Camera System that relies on solar and battery power to eliminate dependence on utility power. For Internet Connection, it uses cellular wireless connection. It is used to monitor the remote industrial operations, such as in the physical construction industry.
