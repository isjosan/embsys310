# Qs & As

Q.a  What is Morse Code?
#### Morse Code is an encoding method used in telecommunications to encode English alphabet characters (A to Z) and decimal numerals ( 0 to 9) into a standardized sequence of 2 different signal durations. The 2 basic signals are called dots and dashes, or dits and dahs. For example,  
#### the character I is represented by the sequence 'dot space dot'  
#### the character Q is represented by the sequence 'dash space dash space dot space dash'
#### the character B is represented by the sequence 'dash space dot space dot space dot'
#### the character A is represented by the sequence 'dot space dash'
#### the character L is represented by the sequence 'dot space dash space dot space dot'
