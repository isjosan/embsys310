# Qs & As

Q a.  What is Morse Code?
#### Morse Code is a basic encoding method used in telecommunications to encode English letters (A to Z) and decimal numerals ( 0 to 9) into a standardized sequence of 2 different signal durations. The 2 basic signals are called dots and dashes, or dits and dahs. For example,  
#### the letter I is represented by the sequence 'dot space dot'  
#### the letter Q is represented by the sequence 'dash space dash space dot space dash'
#### the letter B is represented by the sequence 'dash space dot space dot space dot'
#### the letter A is represented by the sequence 'dot space dash'
#### the letter L is represented by the sequence 'dot space dash space dot space dot'
#### the numeral 9 is represented by the sequence 'dash space dash space dash space dash space dot'
#### For transmission of text in Morse Code, a unit length of time is inversely proportional to the transmission speed measured in 'words per minute' (wpm). For example, the unit length of time could be as high as 1 second, or as low as 1/4 th of a second, or even smaller if an electronic Morse keyer is used. The transmission speed depends on the characteristics of the communication channel, and also the capabilities of the transmission and receiver communications equipment. For a human operator using a mechanical Morse Key (or Telegraph Key), there may be an upper limit to the keying speed of 20 wpm for an experienced operator.
#### The International Standard for Morse Code defines the following signal durations for encoded letters, numbers and words:
#### - Dot has a duration of 1 unit of time.
#### - Dash has a duration of 3 units of time.
#### - Space between parts of the same letter is 1 unit of time.
#### - Space between letters is 3 units of time.
#### - Space between words is 7 units of time.

#### So, the word 'IQBAL' followed by numeral 9 will be encoded in Morse Code as below (Each space is equivalent to 1 unit of time; Morse Code Symbols are in single quotes ' '):
## I 'dot space dot' 'space space space ' Q 'dash space dash space dot space dash' 'space space space' B 'dash space dot space dot space dot' 'space space space' A 'dot space dash' 'space space space' L 'dot space dash space dot space dot' 'space space space space space space space' 9 'dash space dash space dash space dash space dot'

#### Representation of dots and dashes can be done in physical communications channel by the following methods:
#### - Audible Tones representing dots and dashes in frequency range of 600 - 800 Hz.
#### - Visible flashes of monochromatic light, concentrated in a narrow beam in the direction of receiver.
#### - Any other method suitable for encoding and decoding of Morse Code synbols.
