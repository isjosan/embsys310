# Q's & A's  

Follow the same steps as we did in the class to blink LED1 (PA5) at a visible rate using the bit band region to enable the clock for Port A, then answer the following:  

a. What instructions does the compiler produce in assembly for “writing” to the  
RCC_AHB2ENR bit when using bit-band address?  

![bit-band](https://github.com/isjosan/embsys310/blob/master/assignment04/bit-banding/images/bit-band.PNG)

b. What were the instructions produced when writing to the RCC_AHB2ENR without using  
bit-banding?  

![no-bit-bang](   )
